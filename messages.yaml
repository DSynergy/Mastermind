  Welcome to Mastermind! Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players, the code-maker and the code-breaker.
   The modern game was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert.
    In anycase, at the most basic level, I will randomly choose 4 colors and put them in order - duplicate colors are allowed.
     It is your job as the code-breaker to figure out the order of these colors.
      After each guess, I will provide feedback on how many colors you have in the correct positions (exact guess),
       and how many colors you choose correctly but are in the wrong position (near guess).
        I will then record how many guesses and how much time it takes to find the correct code.
         Good luck!
you_win: Winner winner, chicken dinner!
bad_input: Try putting that in again. Spelling?

 I have generated a beginner sequence with four elements made up of: (r)ed, (g)reen, (b)lue, and (y)ellow.
  Use (q)uit at any time to end the game.
   What's your guess?
play: Here we go!
